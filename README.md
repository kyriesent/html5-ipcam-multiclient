html5-ipcam-multiclient
=======================

Monitor multiple IP cameras using HTML5

To configure the client, copy `config.js.example` to `config.js`. You'll need to edit the url of the stream.

Note, each stream needs to have its own separate webSocket port.

Next, run node app.js. You'll probably need sudo rights in order to run it on port 80.

The client is super primitive, a proof of concept really. Enjoy! Feel free to drop any questions in the issue tracker or email me.

Also, please ignore the good looking people in the background who work at my company ;-)
